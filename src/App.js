            The second kind of rollup is a Zero-Knowledge rollup, also known as a ZK-rollup. These protocols use a complex piece of cryptography called a Zero-Knowledge proof to determine that a transaction is valid using only minimal information about that transaction.

Compared with an Optimistic rollup, which requires funds to stay on the network until the dispute resolution period has closed, ZK-rollups allow users to withdraw their funds with less of a delay.
